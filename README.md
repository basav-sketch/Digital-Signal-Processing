# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Assignments

Welcome to the **Digital-Signal-Processing** repository! This repository contains my work for the **DSP** course, where I implemented solutions for three key assignments related to signal processing: **FFT, FIR, and IIR**. Each assignment covers a different aspect of DSP, focusing on understanding and applying fundamental concepts to enhance, filter, and manipulate signals.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
In this assignment, I utilized the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of an audio signal. Key tasks included:
- Loading an audio file and visualizing it in both time and frequency domains.
- Identifying key features, such as fundamental frequencies and harmonics.
- Improving the quality of the audio signal through frequency domain manipulation, focusing on enhancing the clarity of the voice.

### Assignment 2: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter
The second assignment focused on designing and implementing a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)** filter to process signals. Highlights of this assignment include:
- Designing low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass FIR filters.
- Applying these filters to audio signals to observe their effects on specific frequency components.
- Evaluating the impact of FIR filters on the quality and characteristics of the filtered audio.

### Assignment 3: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter
The third assignment explored **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)** filters, which are more computationally efficient compared to FIR filters. This assignment included:
- Designing IIR filters to achieve desired signal processing effects.
- Comparing the behavior of IIR and FIR filters on the same audio input.
- Demonstrating the advantages and trade-offs of IIR filters in real-time signal processing scenarios.

## Repository Structure
- **Assignment_1_FFT/**: Contains the code, plots, and audio files used for the FFT analysis, as well as the report summarizing the results.
- **Assignment_2_FIR/**: Includes the FIR filter design, implementation scripts, and resulting audio files.
- **Assignment_3_IIR/**: Contains the IIR filter implementation, comparison scripts, and results.
- **README.md**: This document, providing an overview of the repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for all assignments.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and FFT implementation.
- **SciPy**: Utilized for FIR and IIR filter design and implementation.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for visualizing the signals in both time and frequency domains.

## Getting Started
To run the code for any of the assignments, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/basav-sketch/Digital-Signal-Processing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired assignment folder.
3. Run the Python scripts using Python 3.

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Results and Discussion
Each assignment has a dedicated section in the respective folder that includes the discussion and analysis of the results. You can find detailed plots, explanations, and the processed audio files demonstrating the effects of the applied DSP techniques.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced filter design techniques, such as adaptive filters.
- Implement real-time DSP applications using FIR and IIR filters.
- Utilize machine learning to automatically determine optimal filter parameters based on signal characteristics.
