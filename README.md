# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Assignments

Welcome to the **Digital-Signal-Processing** repository! This repository contains my work for the **DSP** course, where I implemented solutions for the **FFT** assignment related to signal processing. The focus is on understanding and applying fundamental concepts to enhance, filter, and manipulate signals.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
In this assignment, I utilized the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of an audio signal. Key tasks included:
- Loading an audio file and visualizing it in both time and frequency domains.
- Identifying key features, such as fundamental frequencies and harmonics.
- Improving the quality of the audio signal through frequency domain manipulation, focusing on enhancing the clarity of the voice.

### Future Assignments

#### Assignment 2: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter
The second assignment will focus on designing and implementing a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)** filter to process signals. Planned highlights include:
- Designing low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass FIR filters.
- Applying these filters to audio signals to observe their effects on specific frequency components.
- Evaluating the impact of FIR filters on the quality and characteristics of the filtered audio.

#### Assignment 3: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter
The third assignment will explore **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)** filters, which are more computationally efficient compared to FIR filters. Planned tasks include:
- Designing IIR filters to achieve desired signal processing effects.
- Comparing the behavior of IIR and FIR filters on the same audio input.
- Demonstrating the advantages and trade-offs of IIR filters in real-time signal processing scenarios.

## Repository Structure
- **Assignment_1_FFT/**: Contains the code, plots, and audio files used for the FFT analysis, as well as the report summarizing the results.
- **Assignment_2_FIR/**: Will include the FIR filter design, implementation scripts, and resulting audio files (planned).
- **Assignment_3_IIR/**: Will contain the IIR filter implementation, comparison scripts, and results (planned).
- **README.md**: This document, providing an overview of the repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for all assignments.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and FFT implementation.
- **SciPy**: Will be utilized for FIR and IIR filter design and implementation.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for visualizing the signals in both time and frequency domains.

## Getting Started
To run the code for any of the assignments, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/Digital-Signal-Processing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired assignment folder.
3. Run the Python scripts using Python 3.

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Results and Discussion
The FFT assignment folder contains detailed plots, explanations, and the processed audio files demonstrating the effects of the applied DSP techniques.

## Future Work
- Complete the FIR and IIR filter assignments.
- Explore advanced filter design techniques, such as adaptive filters.
- Implement real-time DSP applications using FIR and IIR filters.
- Utilize machine learning to automatically determine optimal filter parameters based on signal characteristics.
